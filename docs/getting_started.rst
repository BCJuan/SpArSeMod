Getting Started
===============

In this section, the exmple from `Examples <https://github.com/BCJuan/SpArSeMod/tree/reorganize/examples/cnn_cost_example>`_ is explained
to see how SpArSeMod works. 

This is just a tutorial showing how to use SpArSeMod, for the specifics, background theory and related,
reading the paper `SpArSe: Sparse Architecture Search for CNNs on Resource-Constrained Microcontrollers <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12107>`_ is
highly recommended.

In every run we are going to need 4 new components written: search space, network builder, main call and configuration. The use of morphisms is

# Installation Process

This section describes how to install SpArSeMoD in a suitable Anaconda environment. 

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/BCJuan/SpArSeMod`. And move to it `cd SpArSeMoD`
2. Create the anaconda environment from the file `sparse.yml`

`conda env create -f sparse.yml`

3. Install `SpArSeMoD` in that environment: `pip install .`

That's it. In the case that you do not have or use Anaconda, you can use a virtual environment and follow step 3.

Welcome to SpArSeMoD's documentation!
=====================================

SpArSeMOod is a NAS (Neural Architecture Search) framework. It is  specially designed for developing and finding neural networks suitable for
microcontroller deployment, taking into account model size, working memory, accuracy and latency. It is based on the paper
`SpArSe <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12107>`_. 

It is build over PyTorch, GPyTorch and Ax

This documentation describes the framework, how to get started and how to use it.
